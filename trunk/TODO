TODO list for DT::Set, DT::Span, and DT::SpanSet

- implement set( locale => .. ) in Span and SpanSet

- specify what these DT::SpanSet methods should return -
  a datetime, a span, or what - under discussion in datetime@perl.org 
    current( $dt )
    closest( $dt )
- these functions should probably accept both a dt or a span as a parameter, 
  such that they can be used as a kind of iterator - give previous result,
  ask for next.

- discuss functions like 
    is_infinite
    is_empty 

- implement faster DT::Set::complement(), 
  using 'function composition'

- move all 'set-specific' code to Set::Infinite::_recurrence 

- functions like before(), after(), during() might be useful
  in DT::Span
  or maybe these should be called next(), previous(), current(), closest()

- tests for DT::Span and DT::SpanSet 'duration()'
- duration() returns 'Inf' scalar - should be a DT::Duration::Infinite

- rewrite intersection of recurrences 'previous' function
