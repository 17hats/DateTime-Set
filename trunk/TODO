TODO list for DT::Set, DT::Span, and DT::SpanSet

- modify intersection() and other methods that accept a DT object,
  to accept a list of DT objects.  
  Suggested by Ben Bennet, I think.

- all methods should accept/return DT::Infinity objects
  instead of infinity-scalars.
  Modify docs and tests accordingly.
  Note: this should be further discussed in datetime@perl.org before 
        implementing, because it might break other modules tests!

- implement as_list() in DT::SpanSet.pm

- implement previous() in DT::SpanSet.pm

- discuss functions like 
    is_infinite
    is_empty 
    cardinality ?

- implement faster DT::Set::complement(), 
  using 'function composition'

- move all 'set-specific' code to Set::Infinite::Callback ?

- functions like before(), after(), during() might be useful
  in DT::Span
