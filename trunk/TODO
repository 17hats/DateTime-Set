- Redefine Set::Infinite::Arithmetic hashes, to use DateTime
  functions instead of epoch-related internals.
  Actually, it might be better to redo the implementations
  of offset() and quantize()

- Define the new API. Without offset/quantize it is 
  almost impossible to do things like 'every wednesday'.
  It can be done with the iterate() method, but it is
  too difficult.
